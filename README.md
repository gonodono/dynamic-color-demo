A simple example of a `Service`-managed floating `View` with dynamic color.

The app will automatically open the page for the system overlay permission if
it hasn't been granted already.

The floating `View` is a simple `LinearLayout` with a close `Button` and a
couple of dummy `View`s to make color changes more evident. It can be shown
with or without its dynamic color enabled, for comparison purposes.

The themes and colors were created with the
[online Material Theme Builder][builder] and a seed color of #8000FF.
