A simple example of a Service-managed floating View with dynamic color.

The app will automatically open the page for the system overlay permission if
it hasn't been granted already.

The floating View is a simple LinearLayout with a close Button and a couple of
dummy Views to make color changes more evident.

The themes and colors were created with the online
[Material Theme Builder][builder], and a simple seed color of #8000FF.
